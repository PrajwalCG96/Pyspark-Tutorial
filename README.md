# PySpark and Pandas Data Preprocessing Tutorial

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive tutorial that demonstrates how to perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using both PySpark and Pandas. The notebook is designed to help you understand how to clean, transform, and analyze data in both environments, providing a side-by-side comparison of equivalent functions.

## Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you will need the following:

- **Python 3.6 or higher**
- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or 11**
- **Apache Spark**: Pre-built version for Hadoop
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **PySpark** (Installed via pip)
- **A working IDE** (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, PyCharm)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pyspark-pandas-preprocessing-tutorial.git
   cd pyspark-pandas-preprocessing-tutorial
   ```

2. **Set Up Your Environment:**

   Ensure you have all the necessary prerequisites installed. Follow the setup instructions provided in the notebook or see the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

3. **Install Python Dependencies:**

   If you are using a virtual environment, activate it and then run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(Note: You can generate a `requirements.txt` file using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` if needed.)*

## Usage

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook PySpark_Comparison_EDA_Tutorial_with_SQL.ipynb
   ```

2. **Run the Cells:**

   Follow the instructions in the notebook. Each cell contains detailed explanations and code snippets for performing data preprocessing using both PySpark and Pandas.

3. **Sample Data:**

   The repository includes a sample dataset (`sample_data.csv`) that you can use to test the notebook. This data is automatically loaded into the notebook during execution.

## Key Features

- **Data Loading**: Load and compare data handling in PySpark and Pandas.
- **Initial Data Checks**: Perform basic checks like schema validation, summary statistics, and missing value identification.
- **Data Cleaning**: Impute missing values, remove duplicates, and rename columns.
- **Data Transformation**: Convert data types, create new columns, and bin numerical data.
- **Filtering Data**: Filter data using various conditions.
- **Running SQL Queries**: Execute SQL queries directly in PySpark.
- **Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of equivalent PySpark and Pandas code.

## Files in the Repository

- **PySpark_Comparison_EDA_Tutorial_with_SQL.ipynb**: The main notebook containing the tutorial.
- **sample_data.csv**: A sample dataset to be used with the notebook.
- **README.md**: This documentation file.
